[Project: Positioning Elements (with the New York Times)](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/positioning-and-floating-elements)

The New York Times has been a leader in experimenting with the inclusion of multimedia content in traditional stories. That creates all kinds of interesting position questions.

In this project, your assignment is to copy this article from the New York Times(open in an "incognito" window without cookies to view it if you're over your monthly limit). Notice how the section titled "The Theory of Inflation" (you may need to widen your viewing window for it to show up) is laid out.
